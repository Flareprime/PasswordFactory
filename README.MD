## üìö Overview

## ‚úÖ Project Requirements & Features
This project was developed for **CS236 - Advanced OOP (Java 2)** and meets the following requirements:

- **Object-Oriented Design**
  - Inheritance (`PasswordComponent` ‚Üí `PasswordValidator`)
  - Interfaces (`PasswordChecker`)
  - Polymorphism in password validation logic

- **Password Strength Algorithm**
  - Based on length, character variety, and detection of common words
  - Adjustable difficulty settings (Easy, Medium, Hard)
  - Dynamic hint generation for improving password strength

- **File Handling**
  - Loads and saves `common_words.txt` and `phrases.txt`
  - Logs passwords and their strength in `password_log.txt`

- **Graphical User Interface (JavaFX)**
  - **Password Factory Game**: Timed challenge to generate strong passwords
  - **Password Lab**: Sandbox environment for testing passwords and editing phrases/words
  - **About Screen**: Displays system info (Java & JavaFX versions)

- **Testing & Console Apps**
  - `PasswordValidatorTest.java` for unit testing password evaluation logic
  - `PasswordFactoryConsole.java` for early console-based password generation and file handling testing
